# Pothole-Tracker

View the project here -- https://nlr5-capstone-pothole.netlify.app/

For this project, I worked with a team of talented developers to create a Full-Stack pothole tracker. We implemented the Google Maps API where users can:
 - view pins of reported potholes in their area
 - create a new pin and report a new pothole
 - update and schedule pothole inspection and repair dates
 - delete potholes
 
 The tools used for this project were Java, PostgreSQL, Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.
